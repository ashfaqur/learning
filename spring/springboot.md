# SpringBoot

# History

## Why Java EE / Servlet / EJB frameworks were painful

Early Java EE & EJB systems were painful because they were:
- overly complex and configuration-heavy
- tightly coupled to heavy application servers
- slow to develop, deploy, and test
- full of boilerplate and container magic
- designed for unnecessary distributed systems

Spring was created to:
- simplify enterprise Java development
- make code testable and lightweight
- replace EJBs with POJO-based architecture
- give developers control without complexity

Spring Boot later made Spring:
- easier to configure
- faster to start
- simpler to deploy

## What is Spring?

A lightweight, modular Java framework that:
- manages object lifecycle via IoC & DI
- enables loosely-coupled, testable design
- provides tools for web, data, security, integration
- lets you write business logic using simple POJOs

## What Problems Did Spring Solve?

Spring addressed pain points of early Java EE:
- tight coupling & rigid architecture
- heavy containers & slow deployment
- excessive boilerplate & XML configuration
- code that was hard to test
- duplicated cross-cutting concerns

It solved them using:
- Dependency Injection (loose coupling)
- POJO-based design
- AOP for cross-cutting behavior
- declarative transactions & security
- lightweight runtime
